<h1>Riot map</h1>

<p>
  I <a href="http://twitter.com/rakugojon">(@rakugojon)</a> was curious to see what the correlation was between the riots yesterday and deprived areas. Luckily two <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org">Young Rewired Staters</a> (<a href="http://pexat.com/">Priyesh Patel</a> and <a href="http://dansaul.co.uk/">Daniel Saul</a>) who spent time in our office last week had <a href="http://themoodmap.co.uk/">done the hard work with their excellent mood map</a> and imported <a href="http://www.communities.gov.uk/communities/research/indicesdeprivation/deprivation10/">government deprivation data</a> into <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=1246211">google fusion tables</a>. All I had to do was filter this data to just show the areas seen as more deprived (<span class='emphasis'>the top 10% of deprived areas</span> in the UK according to the indice) and overlay it with where riots are occurring. To see the deprived areas, simply zoom in on a marker (signifying a riot). Dark areas nearby represent deprived areas that you can click on. The <span class='emphasis'>darker</span> the area the <span class='emphasis'>more deprived</span>.
</p>
<p>
Originally for the riot data I used <a href="http://t.co/8eSHARc">live London riots map</a> compiled by <a href="http://james.cridland.net/">James Cridland</a>. During Tuesday the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-incident-listed-mapped#data">Guardian released some live data</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/jamescridland">@jamescridland</a> announced he wasn't going to keep his map up to date. Thus the data for riots is now coming from the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdDFMMmRSSWFvTnU3Q2EyaWFNMzlFX2c&hl=en_US#gid=0">Guardian</a> which I've imported into <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?dsrcid=1271090">Google Fusion Tables</a>. You can see the old map using James Cridland's data <a href="crowdsourced.html">here</a>.

<div id="map"></div>

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var options = { zoom:6, center: new google.maps.LatLng(54.085173,-1.933594),
    mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.ROADMAP
  };
  var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), options);

  new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer({query: { select:"geometry", 
    from:"1246211", where: "col18 <= 3248"}, map:map});

    // riot locations
  new google.maps.FusionTablesLayer({query: { select:"col4", 
     from: "1276327"}, map:map});
</script>

<p>
  <h2>Future enhancements</h2>
  It would be interesting in future, to overlay other government data sets on this map such as...
  <ul>
    <li>home locations of arrested people in connection to the riots to see if they live in an area of deprivation</li>
    <li>areas that they have cut funding for social work/education (suggestion via <a href="http://twitter.com/mattlucht">mattlucht</a>)</li>
    <li>ofsted results</li>
    <li>political allegiance</li>
    <li>unemployment figures</li>
  </ul>
  It would also be useful to allow filtering of the data to show sizes and dates of disturbance.
  
  <p>The web is about sharing and improving on others work, so please feel free if interested to reuse this data.
  If you do a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)">mashup</a> based on this, I'd love to hear from you via <a href="http://twitter.com/rakugojon">twitter</a>.</p>

!About the data

The map shows the most deprived areas of the UK. There are 32482 total records in the deprivation data
10% deprived areas in the UK = those with a rank 
32482 * 0.1 = 3248.2
so top 10% deprived areas in UK have a rank less than or equal to 3248
The area that is ranked 3248 has a score of 44.884900
