                                In fact much of our code hadn’t been touched in some time. In addition to this our mobile error counting had also jumped from 10k a minute to 40k a minute with no obvious cause¹ signally we had introduced a
                                bug somewhere. It was clear to the developers tasked with this work, that sophisticated error handling was a requirement for this project.

                                though the audience was low, it gave us a hint about what to expect as we rolled out further. The errors logged were a good way to capture very prominent errors e.g. errors occurring on every page view. Many
                                of these errors had very actionable stack traces meaning we could file bugs and fix them, which we did, however others were more cryptic. “

                                The reason we were getting “Script error” was due to the fact that code was being loaded from across our websites. Many of our users were loading gadgets from other wikis. So while this could it be explained,
                                it was not very actionable without a stack trace. However, it did provide the file which caused the error which could be linked to the associated wiki page. Similar

                                Despite the rate of errors for these smaller wikis being sufficiently low, we knew that there were more errors out there waiting to be explored, the kind that only come from really stretching the use our
                                software — for example editing a wiki page with complicated markup or copying and pasting a table with thousands of rows! We needed to roll out to larger wikis to help prioritize bug fixing in our product

                                These two incidents once fixed got the error rate down to a very manageable and respectable rate of 735 errors ever 3hrs. A lesson was learned and

                                With errors limited, the list of errors was much more manageable, however it was clear that many of the stack traces were not useful. In certain cases, the code was clearly coming from places outside of our
                                control. Interestingly we also saw a lot of bugs from browser extensions and non-Wikimedia domains —
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Translate" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">Google Translate</a> for example and browser extensions like

                                errors did not have any information about stack traces or the source of the error. The noise of this unfortunately made it difficult to identify real errors, so we decided to exclude any errors without
                                information on their origin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">If a bug falls and nobody knows what file it came from</a>,
                                is it really a bug?

                                We however decided to defer the filtering of browser extensions and non-wikimedia sites as this could be taken care of using logstash filtering if needed and it was useful to know,
                                <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T259383" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">however a bug has been filed about reconsidering that in future</a>, potentially sending them to a

                                The end users for the MediaWiki.org and Catalan Wikipedia were not fully representative of all our users so a logic next step was to enable bug tracking on one of our larger language projects written in a
                                right to left text script. Hebrew was an obvious choice, as the community there had previously volunteered for
                                <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_deployment/Train_deploys#Weekly_steps" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">earlier deployments</a> to help us catch errors before they
                                reach production meaning if we saw client errors there we would have time to block the bug before it could impact other projects.
                            </p>
                            <p id="755e" class="hg hh eu hi b fn hj hk hl fq hm hn ho hp hq fv hr hs ht fy hu hv hw gb hx hy em cr" data-selectable-paragraph="">
                                When we enabled the error tracking on Hebrew Wikipedia, the bump in errors was not as significant as it might have been. We didn’t learn much from this deployment, other than we were getting closer to the
                                finish line. Sometimes a deployment just gives you the validation you need to continue.

                                After this, we expanded coverage further to Wikimedia Commons, our site for uploading images. As we’ve rolled out further we’ve benefited more from our scale,
                                <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T262627" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">we noticed problems in our post-processing normalization</a>. Some errors are prefixed with “Uncaught” and
                                some are not. For example, the error <code class="jq ke kf kg kh b">TypeError: $submitButton.submitOnEnter is not a function</code> is the same as
                                <code class="jq ke kf kg kh b">Uncaught TypeError: $submitButton.submitOnEnter is not a function</code> . This meant that similar errors were not being grouped.

                                After a month of roll out a significant milestone was reached when our infrastructure surfaced

                                The majority of the issues that we are now surfacing relate to user gadgets. User gadgets are an historic artifact of the wiki ecosystem that predates browser extensions which have allowed many editors to
                                self-serve and many of our editors depend on them. Some of these <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Gadgets#Usage" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">user written gadgets</a> are
                                defaulted to run for all users, including anonymous users, so we have to be careful that as we roll out further we address or communicate with our editors to get those fixes.

                                are seeing about 60,000 errors a day from 10 <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix" class="bz do hz ia ib ic" rel="noopener nofollow">of the over 2000 sites we maintain</a>.

                                While hopefully obvious, one thing that’s important is that now we have the ability to identify client side errors that we use this information to fix bugs and to block deployments where necessary. Just
                                adding the tool is not enough. This requires a lot of socializing the change, which is partly why I am writing this blog post. I have also started attending a weekly triage meeting and including consideration
                                of these errors in our existing triaging processes. My hope is that all teams working on software for our projects will have a workflow for triaging and addressing such bugs without my assistance.

                                    You could also use page views to restrict the error ingesting to only certain pages.
