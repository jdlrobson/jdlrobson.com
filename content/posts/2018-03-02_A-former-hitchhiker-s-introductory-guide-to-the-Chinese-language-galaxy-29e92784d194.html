I knew what “tai chi” and “yin and yang” referred to, but that was about it. I was happy about that.</p><p name="660c" id="660c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a traveller, I enjoyed going to foreign countries and immersing myself in the confusion and isolation that one can only get from being completely clueless to a language. As I grew older, I would realize that the most precious aspect of traveling is the relationships we form through sharing in conversation.</p><p name="b8e8" id="b8e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My wife Linzy, is fluent in both Mandarin and English and when discussing the subject of whether I should learn Mandarin with her, I confessed that the idea that I could learn Mandarin seemed unfathomable.</p><p name="1fe1" id="1fe1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I explained to her that I’d been learning French since I was ten years old, on and off. Twenty years of learning French and although I am better than most, my French has much room for improvement. Given enough time I can read it; I can plough through <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" data-href="https://www.duolingo.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> exercises with ease; I can speak it confidently in such a way I can navigate a restaurant and I can hear and understand it provided I have a patient speaking partner who responds well to “doucement s’il vous plaît” (slowly please).</p><p name="534a" id="534a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m still not a fluent French speaker. Maybe if I moved there I would be. Maybe if I committed to 5 hours of classes a day, I could. It’s within reach. That said, it had taken twenty years to get to this point and in many ways it had been made easy.</p><h3 name="6240" id="6240" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Romanized alphabet</h3><p name="ccbc" id="ccbc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">French and English both share the Romanized alphabet. There are many words in French that are the same or similar in English. For instance, any English word that ends in “ion” is the same in French. Suddenly armed with the knowledge of a few basic words, you can say things like “J’ai (I have) un television et j’ai la information et j’ai ton (your) attention.” I’ve found these similarities helpful in other Latin based languages. I once had a productive conversation with an Italian where I spoke in broken French and she mixed broken English with Italian (which I do not speak) and I found despite the fact that we did not share a language, somehow we made that work. The human brain is awesome.</p><figure name="574e" id="574e" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 525px; max-height: 421px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 80.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Acy7ldZ_l74qo32WLRJB6Q.png" data-width="545" data-height="437" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Acy7ldZ_l74qo32WLRJB6Q.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Vocabulary is shared amongst Latin based languages. How do I learn a language where there are no shortcuts?</figcaption></figure><p name="6028" id="6028" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The latin based languages seemed achievable, Mandarin didn’t, I explained to Linzy. I drew a crude Venn diagram. Mandarin is so different. It shares nothing with my language. Mandarin words are nothing like English words. They look different. There’s no shortcuts. You have to learn everything from scratch. That’s overwhelming.</p><p name="1eb2" id="1eb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I can’t learn French what chance do I have with Mandarin? My brain doesn’t work that way…</p><h3 name="416c" id="416c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">When needs must</h3><p name="bc3a" id="bc3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Despite this, I wanted to learn how to speak Linzy’s native tongue. She has family members who I cannot speak to. There are times where Linzy will want to say something but the word does not exist in a language we both understand. We battle with cultural differences all the time and I believe if I could only learn her language, our relationship would grow richer and stronger.</p><p name="a8cd" id="a8cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, despite the desire, the reality was overwhelming.

However, what happened instead, was we fell in love with the ten minute warm up act — an Irish-American comedian known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Bishop" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Bishop" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Des Bishop</a>.</p><p name="b0e7" id="b0e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He’d recently gone to China, learned Mandarin with the goal of performing standup comedy there.

Des explained in an extremely humorous fashion, how the 4 tones of Mandarin gave him some hardship in the early days, telling people his name was an unfortunate curse word beginning with “c” due to using the 1st tone (Bī) instead of the 4th (Bì).</p><p name="fddb" id="fddb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Getting the tonal system wrong can have dire consequences, but despite this initial problem, Des made it work, as would I.</p><figure name="3009" id="3009" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 512px; max-height: 340px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 66.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2jv6BSqHhm6pMXq7pfr1ww.png" data-width="512" data-height="340" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2jv6BSqHhm6pMXq7pfr1ww.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">We got this.</figcaption></figure><h3 name="f8c9" id="f8c9" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Speaking is hard</h3><p name="7d03" id="7d03" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Even when the tonal system gets mastered, things can still go awry if the vowel sounds similar. One of my early conversations with Linzy began:</p><blockquote name="c665" id="c665" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Linzy (in Mandarin): What did you eat?<br>Jon (in Mandarin): “Wǒ chī [fèn]”<br>Linzy (in English, laughing): You want to say “I ate rice”, yes?<br>Jon (in Mandarin): Yes.<br>Linzy: “Wǒ chī [fàn]”. Not “Wǒ chī [fèn]”. “Wǒ chī [fèn]” means “I eat 💩”.<br>Jon: 😯</blockquote><p name="2d07" id="2d07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">At the face of this difficulty, I decided to break it down. I was going to focus exclusively on <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">reading</strong> Mandarin from then on. Writing and listening and speaking would come later.</p><p name="b2d8" id="b2d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Linzy laughed.<br>“Isn’t that like learning half the language?”<br>“Well if I can learn Mandarin then I can read the signs in Chinatown… “ I explained… “I’ll be able to read food menus… I’ll be able to point at things and within time the listening and speaking will follow… I think?”</p><p name="04f4" id="04f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Linzy pointed out that the San Francisco Chinatown speaks Cantonese…</p><h3 name="8655" id="8655" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Cantonese</h3><blockquote name="8d7a" id="8d7a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">馬 =&gt; 马</em></blockquote><p name="5f74" id="5f74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Both of these words mean horse. The first is in traditional Chinese and the latter in simplified.</p><p name="6a71" id="6a71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I had never really understood how Mandarin and Cantonese were related. I knew they were different things but I had always figured they were more or less the same. In my ignorance, I’d also come to the invalid conclusion that it was no different from a Yorkshire man speaking to a Londoner. I figured most of the words were the same. I was wrong.</p><p name="a532" id="a532" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was to learn about the difference in character sets. Simplified as the name suggests simplified the traditional characters. Traditional is used in Cantonese and simplified in Mandarin.</p><p name="e4ec" id="e4ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With Linzy’s help I soon realised that many of the characters I’d been teaching myself were traditional, many were simplified and many belonged to both languages.</p><p name="378e" id="378e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If Mandarin is scary. Cantonese is more scary. Not only do the words look more complicated to write, but when speaking Cantonese it involves 6 or 9 tones. At least Mandarin with its 4 tones was beginning to sound a little easier. A little more achievable. I could take comfort in the fact that I was not learning to read Cantonese.</p><h3 name="958a" id="958a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Mandarin is poetic</h3><p name="2f20" id="2f20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">My first breakthrough in learning to read in Mandarin, was realizing that certain characters have a poetry; a history; a beauty to them.</p><p name="e542" id="e542" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some of the characters looked like the thing they represented, for example a mountain (山) or a person (人).

For instance, when speaking to my parent-in-laws I’ll now say “You eat already?” rather than “Have you eaten already this morning?”.</p><p name="4e30" id="4e30" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I began to learn the structure of sentences, I note that the literal Mandarin for I have eaten already is “You eat already?”. I find this interesting, thinking about how Singapore — a country composed of many cultures — a country which counts 4 languages as official (English, Malay, Mandarin and Tamil) — had to find ways that its 4 languages could communicate together.</p><p name="e2fa" id="e2fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 4 languages of Singapore share little in common — Malay can be written in both an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_language#Writing_system" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_language#Writing_system" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arabic (Jawi) and Latin (Rumi) alphabet</a>, while Tamil uses an ancient writing system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language#Writing_system" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language#Writing_system" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Vaṭṭeḻuttu</em></a>. It’s amazing and not really a surprise that the English language, the only common language of these 4, adapted. How much of that had to do with the challenges, not too different from my own, of different backgrounds and writing systems colliding?</p><p name="903b" id="903b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I still have a long way to go with my Mandarin adventure, but I’m starting to feel that I’ve created a path I feel comfortable walking. While I may be very far from fluent, I’m on a journey and anyone with even a slight hesitation of learning Mandarin should not be scared to join me.</p><p name="518a" id="518a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">On my journey, I note, that I am slowly but surely learning more about a language, more about a culture, more about a history and most importantly more about the woman I love.</p></div></div></section><section name="f8b6" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d552" id="d552" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">I’m still learning, so please let me know in the comments, what hacks you are aware of and what mistakes I may have made in this article!
