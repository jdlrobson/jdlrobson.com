We’ve followed an agile approach to development, incrementally building out a grand vision set by our designers. Our first iteration, to our Basque language Wikipedia, was in fact deployed as far back as July 2020. We’ve built responsibly, intentionally, and strategically, thinking holistically about the entire behemoth that is our codebase.

As an engineer, I am so grateful that this project had technical program managers supporting us throughout our daily rituals and helping us overcome any obstacle that was thrown our way. Whether it was throwing people in a room together or just asking the right questions, or negotiating conflicting strongly held opinions, we found solutions to make big impactful changes whether it was using Vue.js or growing trust with each other. Among others, thank you to Jazmin, Lani, Suman, Nat, and Daniel for all your help here.</p>

I am astounded by the quality and respectful feedback many volunteers were able to give us, and by the lengths our team has gone to describe our motivations and goals. For example, the <strong class="ix hh">limited width improvement for reading</strong> has been a controversial feature ever since we introduced it, and when we realized there was no accessible documentation for why something which had been of obvious importance to us, <a class="ae jr" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Desktop_Improvements/Frequently_asked_questions#Why_is_the_width_of_the_content_limited?" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">we wrote documentation ourselves</a>. My work colleagues have organized and executed various office hours, some of which I’ve attended, which often although only scheduled for thirty minutes have massively overrun due to the enthusiasm and engaging conversation we’ve had. Kudos to Alex, Szymon, Olga, Phuong, Martin, Letizia, Sherry, and all the volunteers with their feedback that helped us tweak the new design. </p>
