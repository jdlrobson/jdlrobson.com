HTML tags have been discarded (&lt;b&gt;); repurposed (&lt;small&gt;) or added (&lt;canvas&gt;). Thinking has changed with the advent of new technologies (e.g. <a href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/12/the_fifth_posit.html" data-href="https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2010/12/the_fifth_posit.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">position:fixed and mobile</a>) and as with any medium, some things have been neglected. Print is one of them.</p><p name="5d5f" id="5d5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The role of print has changed with the web. Way back in 2003 the browser print function meant nothing more than “print this website on to a piece of paper”. Its meaning transformed over time.</p><p name="4ae8" id="4ae8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PDF, an invention from 1993, was slowly incorporated into browser print dialogs, but this itself took time, for instance Windows users had to wait till version 10 <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/150891/how-to-print-to-pdf-in-windows-4-tips-and-tricks/" data-href="https://www.howtogeek.com/150891/how-to-print-to-pdf-in-windows-4-tips-and-tricks/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was released in 2015</a> and before that they would have to jump through hoops to set up PDF printers.</p><p name="9b68" id="9b68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As PDFs grew in popularity, the meaning of print on the web changed from print <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to paper</em> to print<em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> to a file I can store on my hard drive</em>.</p><figure name="ac3e" id="ac3e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 657px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 93.89999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*K0BtVKykeO1K60iRzSZEzw.png" data-width="703" data-height="660" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*K0BtVKykeO1K60iRzSZEzw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">2003 Wikipedia (courtesy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031201000000*/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print" data-href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031201000000*/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the wayback engine</a>)</figcaption></figure><p name="00d4" id="00d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">With mobile, this changed again. In 2016, one of the findings of Wikimedia research was that <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/New_Readers_research_findings_presentation%2C_September_2016.pdf" data-href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/New_Readers_research_findings_presentation%2C_September_2016.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">people are increasingly getting information online, then consuming or sharing it offline</a>. Interestingly, the mechanism to deliver a printed artifact, previously used by anyone with a printer, was now being used by people to make content cheaper and more available.</p><p name="ea1c" id="ea1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">People, especially in areas where internet access is slow or not widely available, use the apps they have installed on their phone to turn content into PDF and then use other apps to share them via the small social networks they have — whether it be WhatsApp, WeChat or Xender. It’s important to remember, that while we are making huge strides in technologies such as Service Workers and the Progressive Web Apps built off them — they do not tend to solve this problem of offline sharing — they only support offline consumption.</p><p name="bc19" id="bc19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Going forward to the present day in 2017, my team got a quite modest engineering problem to solve (or so we thought). The goal was to make it easier for <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles" data-href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Reading/Web/Projects/Print_Styles" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia mobile users to print to PDF</a>. It might feel safe to assume that providing a shortcut to download PDFs would be easy. Every browser has a print function. Every browser can print to PDF. Right? Wrong.</p><h3 name="9091" id="9091" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The problems with printing</h3><p name="6dd9" id="6dd9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">The first thing we set out to do was to upgrade how our printed content looked. Our designer, Nirzar, did some designery magic — working out typefaces, margins, paddings, font sizes and line spacing with the goal of optimising our editors content for the printed medium (which is very different to the needs of a web user) — and came up with a mock. It was beautiful. It was exciting to implement and see how it would look on all our content. However, as always with web development there were things we struggled to do while implementing it.</p><h4 name="475f" id="475f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Wasted whitespace</h4><p name="b963" id="b963" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The print medium is different from the digital medium — a major difference being content is constrained to the physical dimensions of a sheet of paper. In the interest of saving paper, we wanted to have more control over things like the recommended printed size e.g. A4/US Letter. The CSS3 spec has thought about this -<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/" data-href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paged media </a>— but, alas that’s in draft and barely supported across browser vendors.</p><figure name="1be2" id="1be2" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 465px; max-height: 593px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 127.49999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*4rKmd6w1slS2HLmuiQmSFA.png" data-width="465" data-height="593" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*4rKmd6w1slS2HLmuiQmSFA.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The trees weeped.</figcaption></figure><p name="ced4" id="ced4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There were also times we wanted to minimise paper wastage. We found the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-before" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/page-break-before" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">page-break-before</strong></a> useful to a certain extent, but it gave undesirable results in certain contexts. We found certain printed page contained much wasted whitespace, but it was difficult to control the threshold — ideally we wanted to break based on the remaining percentage of vertical space of the page. Nothing helped us with this.</p><figure name="b9cb" id="b9cb" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 462px; max-height: 329px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 71.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Rk0BVF_cw7x_Ct7Xrty-gw.png" data-width="462" data-height="329" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*Rk0BVF_cw7x_Ct7Xrty-gw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Background graphics are sometimes important, but it’s up to the user to predict this.</figcaption></figure><h4 name="5063" id="5063" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Page numbers</h4><p name="df08" id="df08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We wanted to show page numbers in our table of contents so that our readers would be able to easily jump to appropriate sections in printed copies or if viewing in a viewer that didn’t support links. Not possible. We had to move on.</p><h4 name="523c" id="523c" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Broken imagery</h4><p name="0fa3" id="0fa3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Wikipedia articles are written in wikitext and much of the content is unstructured. It’s created organically by editors over time using the building blocks of the web — HTML. Many articles make use of CSS background colors to convey pieces of information. When used irresponsibly — thoughts of Geocities websites with full screen background graphics come to mind as anti-patterns— it creates a problem in print mode by using valuable printer ink. As a result, many browser vendors optimise for this by stripping background graphics by default. While that is a sane sensible approach, when removing a full screen background, it’s not so useful on a 40px square HTML element that is supposed to be red and is associated with a pie chart for which it acts as the key. Much of our data is optimised for sharing and translation. Many of the diagrams in Wikipedia tend to separate graphic and text so that graphics can be reused across languages, so there is logic in the approach to using HTML and background colors.</p><p name="11ee" id="11ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A developer could predict this was going to be a problem. If given appropriate APIs the developer could mark up certain elements should always be printed with their backgrounds so the printer would know better, however, no such mechanism is available. Instead, the onus is on the user, to predict this behaviour and find the relevant option in the print dialog interface. Of course, instructions could be left in the web page to explain this, but this is not the early days of the web. We shouldn’t have to.</p><p name="115d" id="115d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sadly, this is the least of things a user needs to be aware of when printing…</p><h4 name="e3a0" id="e3a0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Missing content that cannot be loaded</h4><p name="50b3" id="50b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Many websites, Medium and Wikipedia included, lazy load images or other content to save users bandwidth and avoid serving unnecessary wasted bytes. This is great for people who want to dip into content, but not so good for those who want to take a page offline and read at their leisure. The problem we face is that as soon as a user decides to print a page, via the browser’s menu, they have expressed an intent to read all the content and the web page needs to adapt itself quickly to support that. For users without JavaScript we store images inside noscript tags, but there is no equivalent for when inside the print medium. Maybe there should be?</p><p name="428c" id="428c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the real world, to deal with this problem, as a JavaScript engineer we need to detect intent. A request to print via the browser clearly identifies that intent and can be detected by some kind of JavaScript event, but it’s difficult for websites like Medium and Wikipedia to react on when that happens. There are event handlers that allow you to react to events — <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeprint" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onbeforeprint" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">onbeforeprint</em></a> is the living standard that was thought of for this purpose. It allows you to inject copyright notices into the content for example. However, Chrome, a browser that has made tremendous progress in other parts of web standards doesn’t implement this (although provides an alternative mechanism for those who want it via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">matchMedia</a>).</p><p name="45c4" id="45c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even though mechanisms exists, the standard doesn’t support a use case such as loading image downloads that have been deferred until later. The <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">onbeforeprint</em> event like all JavaScript events are fired <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">synchronously. </strong>The retrieval and display of multiple images is an asynchronous activity which requires communicating with web servers and downloading responses. It’s impossible to print such a page as PDF with all its images. The issue is interesting with various challenges (now encapsulated in a bug against the <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2532" data-href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/2532" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HTML spec</a>) — how long of a delay is acceptable?; How would you deal with images that do not load?; What if asynchronous functions fail? The problem is unlikely to be solved for some time.</p><h4 name="1efb" id="1efb" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Clumsy operating system UIs</h4><p name="682e" id="682e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The solution to dealing with “missing” content seemed trivial at first glance if you use a print button in the UI. The click handler for that button, can make use of the window.print method, calling it only when the page is ready (when images are loaded). There would be no need for feature detection, as pointed out earlier — printing is pretty old school JavaScript. 🐵</p><p name="f748" id="f748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was getting ready to code a solution, but then our designer, pointed out that the printing experience on iOS is pretty poor. In iOS it looks for local printers on your WiFi and provides no PDF option. Unfortunately, printing to PDFs is usually bundled in within the printer dialog and sometimes extremely hidden away without any way to guide the user. For this reason he wanted me to restrict our download mode to the Android platform which appeared to be better optimised for PDF downloading. 🙉</p><figure name="a207" id="a207" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 521px; max-height: 298px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 57.199999999999996%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XNdgIYlw4S5TSBKOfV_JvQ.png" data-width="521" data-height="298" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XNdgIYlw4S5TSBKOfV_JvQ.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Printing to PDF on Firefox on macOS desktop is not as obvious asit could be, while Chrome on Android is very PDF centric.</figcaption></figure><p name="cde2" id="cde2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Like most developers, I hate browser detection. Browser detection always feels like a last resort, but I could see Nirzar’s point. It left a bitter taste in my mouth. It seemed like a missed opportunity. Imagine a world where I could provide parameters to the print function like so:</p><pre name="51c0" id="51c0" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">// potential API one<br>window.print(&#39;pdf&#39;, { size: &#39;A4&#39; } );</pre><pre name="dd5e" id="dd5e" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--pre">// potential other API<br>window.printPDF()</pre><p name="2c3c" id="2c3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">Sadly no API exists. 🙈</p><p name="1904" id="1904" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As someone who scrunches their face at any attempt of browser detection I bit my tongue and said okay, but I managed to relax the requirements to only blacklist the iOS platform. I thought that would be enough and then at least our desktop users could also use the function.</p><p name="db51" id="db51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I should have known better. Frontend development is a maze of woes.</p><h4 name="e6ca" id="e6ca" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">window.print is a lie!</h4><p name="2bbf" id="2bbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I’ve been coding for many many years and the window.print JavaScript function was probably one of the first methods I played with. It was important in my early days of learning JavaScript. It helped me grasp concepts such as progressive enhancement. Printing needed JavaScript, so you needed to think about how to prevent a useless button showing when JavaScript wasn’t available. To solve this of course, there are many approaches. A print button could be accompanied with a &lt;noscript&gt; underneath apologizing profusely for failing to provide a service. Alternative you could create the button via JavaScript. This was an early, enlightening example of strategies and trade offs that I would wrestle with later in my life as a software engineer.</p><p name="6ea3" id="6ea3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As we tested our newly built simple download button across multiple devices, we discovered that in various browsers the button did nothing. Even if you clicked it multiple times!</p><figure name="fcab" id="fcab" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 369px; max-height: 241px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 65.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*kpnjfJSxKDskzUDzoKtAQQ.gif" data-width="369" data-height="241" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*kpnjfJSxKDskzUDzoKtAQQ.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Why can’t I click you?!!</figcaption></figure><p name="954c" id="954c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The function exists in pretty much all browsers, but as my team discovered while debugging this problem, <a href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T179529" data-href="https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T179529" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">calling it in many Android mobile browsers does not invoke the print interface</a>.</p><p name="2fa9" id="2fa9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unexpected things happen when you call window.print() on a mobile browser:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="d85d" id="d85d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Opera on Android has abandoned printing via the browser altogether — it instead has a feature called “offline pages”.

This is quite a complicated project with lots of moving parts. It’s a new service with a maintenance tax that we will have to live with and keep up and running and scale to high volumes of traffic — a cost that would go away if functionality was opened up by a browser vendor. This really shouldn’t be necessary, but it is, and we’re doing it, to help our users share our knowledge better.</p><h3 name="1d08" id="1d08" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Conclusions</h3><p name="fb5a" id="fb5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Technologies like Service Workers only solve part of the offline picture.

Does it have a role to play in the future of the web? Is PDF a format that will still be around in the decades that follow? If not, what is the alternative? How will we share web pages without being locked into an internet connection?</p><p name="4ead" id="4ead" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see little activity in this area. Is it the role of the web developer to make use of APIs e.g. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">URL.createObjectURL</a> to make their content available offline? Is it the role of the browser vendor? Is it the role of the platform? Is this something that can be built on top of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share" data-href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">navigator.share</a> API? Google Chrome is now shipped with a feature to take this page offline, yet that doesn’t lend itself too the save and share paradigm. Maybe this is a problem browser vendors should solve, maybe it’s not up to developers, but there’s no clear direction yet, at least from my perspective. All that is clear is there is a gap that needs filling.</p><p name="9719" id="9719" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PDF seems to be the popular standard for taking content offline, but is it the most future proof of solutions? Would HTML be a better model if it played more into the platform? The <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" data-href="http://tiddlywiki.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TiddlyWiki notebook tool</a> that I used to help build has been doing this for many years. If PDFs are the preferred medium, what does it have that HTML doesn’t? Consistency across platforms? Does that still apply in 2017?</p><p name="a0f3" id="a0f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Print medium is important — people still prefer to detach themselves from their devices or are forced to detach from their internet whether it be cost, internet availability or preference (I still refuse to ever read an ebook… but that’s another story). People use the content we create on the web in interesting and unexpected ways, whether that be delivering content to a school or sharing content with a friend over Bluetooth. We cannot rely on distribution via a readily available web.</p><p name="99b3" id="99b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’ve built some great foundations in our web standards — media queries are a wonderful tool that allow us to transform our content for use cases, but there still feels like lots of low hanging fruit for making the printed medium more useful.</p><p name="17e9" id="17e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is print something we want to keep or discard?</p><p name="adbe" id="adbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’ve enjoyed this article, please try sharing it as an offline PDF or web page with your friends and let me know how that goes for you in the comments…</p><p name="585e" id="585e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…</p><p name="dfb7" id="dfb7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, some asks directed at browser vendors:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4237" id="4237" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Please remember feature detection when removing features like window.print — make those methods undefined if they don’t do anything. There should be no excuses for browser detection.</li><li name="1f8e" id="1f8e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Think about providing and maturing APIs for things you are already providing elsewhere in the browser like print generation and provide better shortcuts to PDF printing.</li><li name="ab06" id="ab06" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--trailing">Allow for asynchronous behaviour in PDF generation. Alternatively, help give developers the tools to minimise data usage without impairing the usefulness of printed content.</li></ul></div></div></section>
